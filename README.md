The goal of shinyleaves is to explain the process behind estimating leaf area 
from scans with an interactive shiny app.

## Installation

You can install shinyleaves from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("richardjtelford/shinyleaves")
```

## Example

Run the app with

``` r
library(shinyleaves)
shiny_leaves()
```

You can either use the leaves within in the package or supply your own.

## Shinyapps

If you want to quickly try `shinyleaves`, it is available on [shinyapps.io](
https://richardjtelford.shinyapps.io/shinyleaves/).
If you use it a lot, please install it locally or my shinyapps allowance will be all used up.
